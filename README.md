## Metamason Coding Challenge ##

### Submission by Nate Hart ###

To run the application, clone the repo from [github](https://github.com/hartbeatnt/MetamasonCodingChallenge)
then enter the following commands into a command-line terminal
in the project's root directory to install dependencies and
create the bundle:

>npm install
>
>webpack

After that, open index.html in your browser and use your keyboard's 
arrow keys to cycle through the image gallery.

Enjoy!
